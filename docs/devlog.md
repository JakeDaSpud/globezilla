- made game idea
- made godot project
- made gdd mostly, with MVP
- made repo
- going to use godot 4.3 and hopefully single-threaded web exporting means i don't have to use a NodeJS server to run it locally? if so, that's fine, i'll still be testing it on itch.io lol
- i have good ideas for the itch.io page theming too! hopefully this pans out smoothly...
- made globe blockout
- made test level

- spent 2 hours trying to use other people's 3d player controller scripts, yeah wow i'm just going to make my own i guess
- just going to focus on simple movement, using this 3rd person camera addon i found too
- damn that took too long, i had self.position + direction as the target, when i just needed the direction for my calculation...
- package time ! !
- added package, package_spawn_location
