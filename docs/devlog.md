i didn't even know i was going to do this jam, but i came up with the idea once i heard the theme! what a fun way to live: spontaneously!

- made game idea
- made godot project
- made gdd mostly, with MVP
- made repo
- going to use godot 4.3 and hopefully single-threaded web exporting means i don't have to use a NodeJS server to run it locally? if so, that's fine, i'll still be testing it on itch.io lol
- i have good ideas for the itch.io page theming too! hopefully this pans out smoothly...
