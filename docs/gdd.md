### _Inspiration_
[Diddy Kong Racing (N64 / DS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diddy_Kong_Racing):\
I was thinking about this game a lot recently, I played the DS remake and loved it, I like how chunky the planes and cute characters are, so I wanted to try modelling the plane mechanics in my own game, but it will be post-MVP.
- Planes
- Vibrant Colours
- Level Design
- Models in general

[Katamari Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari):\
I love the cute polygon styling of Katamari, my concept is similar too. The colours really pop.
- Colours
- Art Style / Direction

[Crossy Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossy_Road):\
The colours and low-effort modelling is something I want for my game too.
- Colour contrast
- Polygon Models
