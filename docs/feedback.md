jake what I would say is make the map much bigger
and have the circle change colour when its a target
looks cool
could prolly just scale it 3x
game worked for me though its fun
[jake]: i wanted to have an easy / hard difficulty so that you could have an arrow that points to the destination if ur on easy, otherwise the main "educational" aspect of the game is internalising WHERE the countries are lol
id say a lil indicator you can toggle on and off would be perfect
ypu got the red dots and detection for current target id just make it yellow when its a target or sm
[jake]: oooo maybe i have it on always and it's just a hint arrow
[jake]: like the button is always there

19.87
seconds
my fastest
[jake]: bruh how'd u instantly beat my pb
2nd attempt too
i think it was because whenever i would deliver one in europe
and got another in europe
and then ANOTHER in europe
so my 15 filled up really quick
[jake]: yeah that happens a lot, i have too many in europe lol
[jake]: feedback what do u think
[jake]: all the good parts and bad parts
europe looks like a meteor hit it
italy is like broken up
might be hard to see it i guess?
idk
there wasnt anything bad or very good
def too many countries for europe though
and maybe put russias dot on moscow
instead of the very top of the country
or was that on purpose
maybe make multiple maps
the americas; europe; africa; asia
[jake]: i was trying to place the dot in the rough centre of every country lol
oh
[jake]: and yeah a lot of places got broken up bc of the way i made the map
[jake]: used to be many more holes
ohh
[jake]: the multiple maps is a good idea, but not for this jam, don't have that kinda time
